<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Abigail Osemudiamen and i am a beginner in web devel0pment. I have always been interested
 in technology and creating things, and web development seemed like a perfect way to show those interests. </p>

<p>While I am just starting out in web development, I am eager to learn and grow my skills. I have completed some 
basic web development courses and tutorials, and I am now working on my own projects to further develop my skills.
</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in front-end web devel0pment, as I enjoy the design and user experience aspects of
creating websites. I am also excited about the constantly envolving nature of web development and the opportunity 
to continually learn and improve.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technology and experimenting with different coding langauages. I also enjoy
reading, and spending time with family and friends. </p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read a bit about me and my journey in web devel0pment. I am excited about the 
possibilties ahead and look forward to connecting with others in the field.</p>
